I visit Twitch.tv pretty regularly. It’s a great platform to check out streamers in all categories from predominantly gaming to fringe hobbies. Part of the user experience on Twitch involves scrolling through channel thumbnails that are supposed to give you a peek into the streamers current activities. Well, this isn’t exactly what happens. Let me explain…quite often a streamer is doing something different than what is depicted in the thumbnail. So you click on a stream and find that they are not actually doing what you expected. Bummer, time to go back a page and repeat the process. This is silly, and a lot of back and forth travelling which is annoying for the user. It wouldn’t be too bad except Twitch.tv loads very slowly, very slowly.

I thought to myself, “it would be so nice if I could get a live sneak peek of a channel that I’m interested in by just hovering my mouse over the channel or something”. So I began working on a userscript to do exactly this, [https://github.com/JohnBjorge/Twitch-Preview](https://github.com/JohnBjorge/Twitch-Preview "Twitch-Preview"). During the project I gained familiarity with cross browser compatibility, the Twitch API, and jQuery. Overall, it was a fun project and hopefully Twitch will implement something similar in the future.  Feel free to check out [Twitch-Preview!](https://github.com/JohnBjorge/Twitch-Preview)
